Saraphina walked along the cobbled streets of Jumia. The bone white stone was turned into a rainbow mosaic by the sun streaming powerfully through the canopy of tarps. She had arrived yesterday and had been advised to dress in the ways of the Jumi. She glanced down haughtily at her exposed chest and form fitting but minuscule waist cover. Her dark, firm breasts bobbed slight with her gait and she tried to remember when she last had such an opportunity to show off her body. She pushed back the thoughts about how she felt her areolas were too large and that her right breast was noticeably larger and more perky then the left. At 45 her adventurous life style on the road had granted her both hard muscle and fatty curves both right where they were needed. She smiled as she swished her hips and the bright red lacy skirt swayed with them. She wore more jewelry on her body than had ever previously owned but her patron had insisted that not putting any would have her looking the part of a wastrel. She had feigned embarrassment about the heavy ruby body jewels that started at her neck and mostly draped over and encircled her tits. 

She found that she was perhaps more conservitebely dressed than most people on in the busy market place.

She was meeting with the merchant queen of Jumia today. Tameeka Jumia was not an actual queen of course, Jumia having been established on principles of anarchy and communism since it beginnings. She was however the woman who organized all trade coming in and out of Jumia since she helped found the city 30 years ago. Since thst time Jumia although small has become one of the richest cities in eastern Grandia. She was also one of the msot accomplsiehd athrimancers outside of the Logic School and the only one of note to not have ever even witnessed those orderly halls. 

Serphina walked up to the large tent and gazed at the geometric shapes and lines that crisscrossed its surface. It took her a moment to realize he lines were moving subly shift to form different angles and shapes. She suddenly got the vague impression that the shapes and lines were displaying concrete information of some kind. There eemed to be an underlying organization that although she could not read was still observable. She walked inside.

You look directly at the beautiful woman whom you presume to be Tameeka Jumia. She meets your eyes after giving your body a quick look over. Her eyes are a deep brown and full of intelligence. Her skin is a shade darker than yours and her hair is short, curly, and purple. She is wearing a cloak that seems reminiscient of those common among proffessional magical users and teachers but was bright orange and cropped short above her navel showing off her toned stomach, the robe was garish but still managed to be stylish. You get the dinsticnt impression it was both a slight jab at the solemn attitude often associated with such folks and an unironic appreciation for critical magical application and study.

THe woman seated in the center of the room smiles self assured and with a smidge of humour. &quot;Greetings Serphina Arturia Orryn-Smithe III of House Ophelia. Im delighted to finally meet you in person. I have been excitedly awaiting our date for a while now.&quot; She looks intently at your body scanning up and down several times. YOu clear your throat quietly and struggle and almsot succeed in keeping your cheechs from reddening. &quot;As I said in our letters this is not a date. I wish to interview you in a personal manner as is my custom when fact finding for my book.&quot; 

&quot;But you do wish to get to know me, no? I belive that is called a date especially with one so beautiful as yourself. Do you not find me attractive Serphina?&quot; She smiles slyly as she waits for your response.

A group of youths where sitting in a close circle in the back of the tent heads down, chanting. They wore robes similar to the women seated in the center of the room but they were a deep gray. As you listen closer you realize theya re chanting numerical and logical proofs and rules in quick succession. Black two dimensional lines and symbols flow out from the center of their circle. The symbols float and drift  outward in all directions until they come in contact with the tent and vanish into the fabric. This msut be the soruce of the complex lines on the exterior and you presume this tobe the sort of high level calcualtion rituals associated with arithamcancers and you take mental pictures and notes to write down later.


	&quot;The tent actually serves both a ledger of all trading coming in and out of the city as well as calulcating costs of all routes, keeping track of market value of goods in all trade territories, and determines the most profit efficient action to take.&quot;
	&quot;In case your wondering its all in a code of my own devise in case foreign traders wish to know where, when, and what we plan on importing and exporting in the following months, But theya re welcome to try adn crack it. I figure I can waste their time more by having them try and crack my code than simply learning to be good economists.&quot;

<tw-passagedata pid="16" name="The ritual completes" tags="" position="873,1705">THe chanting of the students stopped abruptly. Each of the students stood up suddenly and began to hum deeply in unison. they stood up straigt but their posture suggested they were about to spring into action. Their humming grew louder, what started as a simple bass note grew quickly in complexity. It rose up and down like waves, growing louder in strict measured patterns. Suddenly half the students broke off to hum the opposite side of the patern from the rest of the students. Soon a third group broke off to hum the mid point between the two extremes. Interlocking patterns wove into eachother in bewildering streams of sounds. Suddenly all the voices were humming a different part of the whole interlocking structure. 

I got an impression of an immsense structure in my mind. A hulking palace made of rules and logic and immutability. And then it crumbled. A single student, a woman hedghog-kin, had began to hum erratically. She leapt into motion her legs bending and her torsotwisting as her arms spun as she leapt gracefully into the air. Her humming grew more and more erratic and became melodic shouts and noises the mouth can make that we donbt ahve words for. She began to spin and leap in the cneter of the circle never stopping her chaotic but musical solo. 

Suddenly three other students joined in, not into her song but their own losing all semblence of structure but dispalying deep meotions. As the students danced I saw that each were growing increasingly emotional one sad, one jubilant, another angry and the emotions came out more and more int their actiosn and erratic melodic shouts. Suddenly all the students were leaping and spinning and crying and laughing and acreaming in all manner of emotions amd forms of song and noice. 

Tameeka looked on without betraying any sort of discernable reaction to these bizare events. Suddenly the woman who had started hte mad dancing halted and screamed out a stream of numbers. She screamed as if in pure adulation and pleasure. Her robes visibly wettened around her crouch and she continued to scream out the stream of numbers. One of the other students pulled themselvws away from the throng and roduced a sheet of apper and pencil from their robes. They began scribbling down the numbers and made a effort to continue listening to the screaming woman and double checking the numbers he had written down. After she had repeated her formula multiple times the student seemed pleased and wlaked the paper over to Tameeka for obviuos inspection. The rest the students were calming down and some had also lef the circle nodding apprecitaley to the student who had written down the proofs. 

Tameeka was reading the sheet intently and then spoke the whole formula outloud in a commanding voice, intoning not perfeclty but perfeclty intune with her own indiosincracies of speech. A single golden three dimensional shape popped into existentence in front of her unlike the simple black lines from before this one danced in place it bounds not scrict but almsot like Alchemist&#39;s Jelly. It flitted to and frow aimlessly and playfully. Tameeka made a quick hand gesture and the shape suddenly started shrinking. It became darker and densr as it shrunk until it was about the size of a large grape. It was black and solid now, rather mundane looking except for its unique shape. It was an icosagon and what at first appeared to be rough edges were in fact minute but dizzyingly complex shape acrocc the whole surface. You have never seen anyhting quite so complex on such a small scale before. The minutua of the detail is breathtaking.

Tameeka hands the shape to the student wh had proclaimed the proof. The student took it with obviuos excitement and gratitude and cupped in in her hands as if it was fragile and expensive. 

&quot;Seraphina, I belive it is time for us to leave.&quot;

My parent was a proffesional mage. They were always so self possessed. They used their magic to do everything. It was like an extension of thier confidence. I always admired how it seemed like nothing could ruffle thier feathers. It was hard learning that was a lie, but like all fiction that gives its power as well. Truth bend with the world. like a flower in the breeze. Fictions move outside this dimension in higher vibrations. They can mimic reality without being constrained. I realized that if everyone viewed me as I viwed my guardian then reality could bend my way. atleast in a small way. 

And thats why I taught myself arithmancy without the aid of the school. The logic school has of course been a nuisance and even tried to forcibly enroll me at the age of 26. they have some rather strong opinions about not wasting arithmancy on &quot;pointless&quot; ventures. Apaprently i am tarnishing the good name. 

My students here though will show the effecacy of my methods. that is if they can actually get off their lazy asses long enough to learn the basics. 

Do you dabble in magic, Seraphina?

<tw-passagedata pid="21" name="head to outskirts" tags="" position="691,1864">The Desert-of-the-Splintered-Prism stretches before you as you sit with Tameeka on scaffolding that has been covered with several blankets to make it a comfortable place to sit. Th desert is a pure blak color. Its sands are made up of a strange set of minerals and the entire expanse is an inky sea broken up only by the gigantic jewels that are its namesake. You see a fair number not too far off. Huge boulders of color. they glowed with a brilliant inner light. Each like a sun but purple or green or red. Rainbow stars in a black sky. You had heard people say that pieces of the gems could amplify your magical ability but you were skeptical consierding you had never heard the bold claim about the stones before someone had been trying to sell you a chunk of Holly Blue Agate. 

&quot;Beautiful isnt it? I never quite get ued to it. Its kind of like looking out over the sea. Reminds me that no matter what happens there is so much going on beyond our lives, even jsut witht he lives of other people let alone other Beings. Keeps my mind clean, peaceful.&quot;

A moment passes in quietude as you look out over he gorgeous expanse, transfixed by its enormity.

&quot;What stories have you been told about the origins of the Prism? Every culture has thier own and everyone in it thier own versions. When i was young someone once told me a story about how each stone fell out of the stars. She said they came from palces that reside out of time and space and that each one brought with it a different form of love and that love is so amazing because it we were never meant to have it in the first palce. I miss her very much. 

Each stone is actually a different color. Technically none of them are nomral gemstones at all. We call the red one&#39;s rubies out of convenience but you will never find two with the same hue.&quot;

&quot;I can easily imagine a phenomenon like this ahving many tales told about it. What actually formed the Prism?&quot;

&quot;Seraphina, you sound like the mages from the Logic School. I udnerstand the nature of your book but are you really going to try and put forward a &quot;true&quot; account of the world&#39;s wonders?&quot; 

&quot;Isnt that a bit odd coming from a Arithmancer? Numbers are certainly immutable.&quot;

&quot;How would you go about proving the existence of mathmatics? Its a tautaology, it holds itself up by its own existence. Or doesnt dependng on what side of that strange loop you want to position yourself. The Logic School rejects faith and the gods and yet they state mathmatics exists objectively in the world. Can they show you math? Can they observe and measure it with any outsdie of math itself? I view it as no less mystical than any other form of magic. It is simply one we have created together.&quot;

You snort before rleasing a long clear laugh. &quot;Tameeka you are an absolute darling, I meant for you to tell me how you belive the desert was formed. I am writing  book of tolerance I view the truth of all people&#39;s perspectives.&quot; 

Tameeka&#39;s eyes widen slightly and the moment passes. &quot;Of course. I was simply probing your ideas. We should move on to what you came all the wy here to ask me.&quot;

<tw-passagedata pid="22" name="head to fountain" tags="" position="998,1861">The Fountain of the Unnamed Goddess in Jumia&#39;s center has a lot of urban rumors concerning it. Aged citizens toss in possessions of personal value at midnight in hopes of being blssed to live forever in the Rose Sea after death. Youths say that if you walk towards the fountain without realizing you are about to approach it you will walk forever without reaching it until you notice where you are. On the high holidays almsot every spiritual celebration begins or ends up at the fountain. The Unnamed Goddess is part of no orgainized religious canon. There are no records of her being patron to any group or location. Her followers pray to her in thier own ways, quitely. The leading suspicion be ing that she is msot pleased by praise that is humble as herself. A goddess known only by a statue created quietly by an unknown sculpter during the chaotic early days of Jumia&#39;s founding. 

The Fountain depicts a woman seated utop a mound of knarled and overgorwn branches. Small human-like creatures made of flower petals are depicted as attending to the variuos flowers and thorns that bespeckle the boughs. The woman is quietly weeping the tears trail down her face and fall below into the knotted unseen center of the mound. the entire scultpture is amde of what appears to be a ston similar to marble but light pink in color with very thin sinuous vains of gold streaking throughout. No locals are able to place the origin of the material pr even its composition. 

You are sitting on a stone bench in front of the fountain with Tameeka. The open square around the fountain is busy with people enjoying the greenery near the fountain, the only substantial amount in Jumia. 

&quot;But how was the sculpture able to make an entire fountain without anyone noticing?&quot;

&quot;They werent unnoticed, they were unrecorded. Jumia was settled quite rapidly after the settlers made the area habitable. Lots of tents, cobblestones, and goods moving every which way. So no one knows who made it or why, I mean its beautiful. I hope they were paid well for it. Its become a social hub for Jumia. Maybe they just felt a merchant town in the middle of a desert needed a bit of gentle beauty.

SHe leads you to a pitch black tent draped in large chains studded with gemstones of all colors. As you enter you see it is very well lit. You see a man in a uniform, the stuffiest person you have seen here in jumia, fiddling with what appeared to be a large lantern. He seemed to be inspecting the hinges, he unfastened one with a practiced hand and then re-fastened it then immeditely went to inspecting the rivets which he pried apart with a small metal tool and then reforged with with a small metal rod with a red gemtstone set in the top and glowed brightly. He seemed to be making adjsutments though you can hardly interpet what changes he is making. His economy of motion was such that he never stopped moving and he seemed lost in the movements. 

&quot;This is one of the finest jewelers in the city which as you can assume is an incredible feat in Jumia.&quot;

A man wearing only body jewellry made of sinuous metals trnades that encircles all his major appendgaes smiles broaldy at Tameeka.

&quot;Ah ha! You have come around hanvt you? I knew you would. Our prices are as they are becuase our quality is simply superior to the rest! It was inevitable that a discerning woman such as yourself would take heed of this. My memory sevres that you wnated to ship out 3 lapis-lazulis, 4 pearls, and 1 black pearl to Lucreport by end of next month. Arrangements are already partially underway-&quot;

&quot;Alexandria I am not here to discuss such business and as I ahve said to you many times I am still deciding what jeweler can best cater to my needs.&quot;

 Tameeka gestures as you playfully and with a bit more affection than you were expecting.
 
 &quot;My dear friend Serpahina here is making the msot of her viisit to Jumia and wants be outfitted in some of our treasures.&quot;

THe bejeweled man seemed glum for about half a moment and then strode toward you.

&quot;My you are a beauty! Hhhhhhmmmm yes I think amethysts would serve well with your complexion. What sort of peircings are you open to?&quot;

He puts his face right in front of your stomach as if inspecting a quality canvas. 

&quot;Three large black iron circlets going down each side of the stomach linked with small chains with amethysts set in bewteen the links. Hhhhhhmmmmm but your an active person I cna see that. They would jangle around and get caught on things, quite unpleasant. Strands of interlocking metal, Ishe perhaps, around the breats. Leaving the nipple and areaolas bare but beginning as the top of the breat and extending to two inches below the breast and then encircling the sternum. I could use a single heavy ring then and it would be quite durable. Might even deflect soemthing unfriendlfy.&quot;

He halted his rambling to inspect the variuos scars across your body.

&quot;Yes I think that is what we want.&quot; 

&quot;Um how expensive is this going to be?&quot;

&quot;Our dear friend Alexandria here owes me a non-significant amount of money in lsot assets after a rather disasterous gem harvest.&quot;

&quot;Now now Tameeka it&#39;s rude to bring up the past.&quot; 
Alexandria gesture for you to sit on a stool.
&quot;I will begin by taking your measurments and then you and Tameeka can make yourselves comfy while I ply my craft.&quot;

&quot;Now Seraphina I believe it is time to get to the crux of our meeting. What wuld you like to know about?&quot;
