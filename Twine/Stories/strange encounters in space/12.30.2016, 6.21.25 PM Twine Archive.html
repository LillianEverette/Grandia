<tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Pray to the Unknown Goddess." tags="" position="613,239">You are surrounded by blackness. shadows writhe all around, a infitne series of vague shapes that spill in and out of coherence. You see the flickering shapes of your loved ones. Angry shadows of things you hate and despise. your favorite flavours flow onto your tongue on the air. you hear the sounds of your lovers whispering sweetness into your ear. you see your father. you recall your darkest thougts, your kindest ideas. A sahdowy hand forms out of the blackness. it rears up to strike you. What do you do?

<tw-passagedata pid="4" name="A Fluttering Rainbow Canopy" tags="" position="1217,231">Marlbara Desert: The sun shimmered down lighting up the hundreds of patterns from the drapes, canvases, and colorful tarps that canopied the city. Every house and vendor had thier own personalized hsade from the sun those few seemed to choose anything approaching drab. Brilliant blues, purples, oranges, and pinks seemed to domianate. The dye market turned hefty profits the year round, evryone keen to the idea that their best design choices were ahead of them.

<tw-passagedata pid="5" name="The Errant Girl" tags="" position="1155,381">
Saraphina walked along the cobbled streets of Jumia. The bone white stone was turned into a rainbow mosaic by the sun streaming powerfully through the canopy of tarps. She had arrived yesterday and had been advised to dress in the ways of the Jumi. She glanced down haughtily at her exposed chest and form fitting but minuscule waist cover. Her dark, firm breasts bobbed slight with her gait and she tried to remember when she last had such an opportunity to show off her body. She pushed back the thoughts about how she felt her areolas were too large and that her right breast was noticeably larger and more perky then the left. At 45 her adventurous life style on the road had granted her both hard muscle and fatty curves both right where they were needed. She smiled as she swished her hips and the bright red lacy skirt swayed with them. She wore more jewelry on her body than had ever previously owned but her patron had insisted that not putting any would have her looking the part of a wastrel. She had feigned embarrassment about the heavy ruby body jewels that started at her neck but mostly draped over and encircled her tits. 

She found that she was perhaps more conservitebely dressed than most people on in the busy market place.

<tw-passagedata pid="6" name="A large couple holding hands." tags="" position="818,540">A tall skinny man wearing only deeply worn shorts and messy bleached hair skips along closely by a fat man with a giant gold ring in his sizable navel. His face is obscured by a heavy satin blue mask that obscures most of his head. They match eachothers stride despite the tall man walking with a slight unveneess due to a missing leg repalced by a sleek iron rod. They gabber excitedly together about a performance tonight in one of the city theater houses.

The leash is slack but the woman still manages to lead her pet by subtle flicks of the leash. The younger person is wearing a simple but immaculatley clean white cloak.
