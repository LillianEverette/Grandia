A sahdowy hand forms out of the blackness. it rears up to strike you. What do you do?

The dye market turned hefty profits the year round, evryone keen to the idea that their best design choices were ahead of them.

<tw-passagedata pid="5" name="The Errant Girl" tags="" position="895,385">
Saraphina walked along the cobbled streets of Jumia. The bone white stone was turned into a rainbow mosaic by the sun streaming powerfully through the canopy of tarps. She had arrived yesterday and had been advised to dress in the ways of the Jumi. She glanced down haughtily at her exposed chest and form fitting but minuscule waist cover. Her dark, firm breasts bobbed slight with her gait and she tried to remember when she last had such an opportunity to show off her body. She pushed back the thoughts about how she felt her areolas were too large and that her right breast was noticeably larger and more perky then the left. At 45 her adventurous life style on the road had granted her both hard muscle and fatty curves both right where they were needed. She smiled as she swished her hips and the bright red lacy skirt swayed with them. She wore more jewelry on her body than had ever previously owned but her patron had insisted that not putting any would have her looking the part of a wastrel. She had feigned embarrassment about the heavy ruby body jewels that started at her neck and mostly draped over and encircled her tits. 

She found that she was perhaps more conservitebely dressed than most people on in the busy market place.

She was meeting with the merchant queen of Jumia today. Tameeka Jumia was not an actual queen of course, Jumia having been established on principles of anarchy and communism since it beginnings. She was however the woman who organized all trade coming in and out of Jumia since she helped found the city 30 years ago. Since thst time Jumia although small has become one of the richest cities in eastern Grandia. She was also one of the msot accomplsiehd athrimancers outside of the Logic School and the only one of note to not have ever even witnessed those orderly halls. 

Serphina walked up to the large tent and gazed at the geometric shapes and lines that crisscrossed its surface. It took her a moment to realize he lines were moving subly shift to form different angles and shapes. She suddenly got the vague impression that the shapes and lines were displaying concrete information of some kind. There eemed to be an underlying organization that although she could not read was still observable. She walked inside.


[[A dark woman of 50 some years.]]

[[&quot;Greetings Tameeka Jumia. I am Seraphina, here for our meeting.]]

You look directly at the beautiful woman whom you presume to be Tameeka Jumia. She meets your eyes after giving your body a quick look over. Her eyes are a deep brown and full of intelligence. Her skin is a shade darker than yours and her hair is short, curly, and purple. She is wearing a cloak that seems reminiscient of those common among proffessional magical users and teachers but was bright orange and cropped short above her navel showing off her toned stomach, the robe was garish but still managed to be stylish. You get the dinsticnt impression it was both a slight jab at the solemn attitude often associated with such folks and an unironic appreciation for critical magical application and study.

THe woman seated in the center of the room smiles self assured and with a smidge of humour. &quot;Greetings Serphina Arturia Orryn-Smithe III of House Ophelia. Im delighted to finally meet you in person. I have been excitedly awaiting our date for a while now.&quot; She looks intently at your body scanning up and down several times. YOu clear your throat quietly and struggle and almsot succeed in keeping your cheechs from reddening. &quot;As I said in our letters this is not a date. I wish to interview you in a personal manner as is my custom when fact finding for my book.&quot; 

&quot;But you do wish to get to know me, no? I belive that is called a date especially with one so beautiful as yourself. Do you not find me attractive Serphina?&quot; She smiles slyly as she waits for your response.


[[Perhaps you have a point, dear Tameeka. And you are even prettier thand escribed. Shall we begin our date then?]]

A group of youths where sitting in a close circle in the back of the tent heads down, chanting. They wore robes similar to the women seated in the center of the room but they were a deep gray. As you listen closer you realize theya re chanting numerical and logical proofs and rules in quick succession. Black two dimensional lines and symbols flow out from the center of their circle. The symbols float and drift  outward in all directions until they come in contact with the tent and vanish into the fabric. This msut be the soruce of the complex lines on the exterior and you presume this tobe the sort of high level calcualtion rituals associated with arithamcancers and you take mental pictures and notes to write down later.


	&quot;The tent actually serves both a ledger of all trading coming in and out of the city as well as calulcating costs of all routes, keeping track of market value of goods in all trade territories, and determines the most profit efficient action to take.&quot;
	&quot;In case your wondering its all in a code of my own devise in case foreign traders wish to know where, when, and what we plan on importing and exporting in the following months, But theya re welcome to try adn crack it. I figure I can waste their time more by having them try and crack my code than simply learning to be good economists.&quot;
