<tw-passagedata pid="5" name="The Errant Girl" tags="" position="895,385">
Saraphina walked along the cobbled streets of Jumia. The bone white stone was turned into a rainbow mosaic by the sun streaming powerfully through the canopy of tarps. She had arrived yesterday and had been advised to dress in the ways of the Jumi. She glanced down haughtily at her exposed chest and form fitting but minuscule waist cover. Her dark, firm breasts bobbed slight with her gait and she tried to remember when she last had such an opportunity to show off her body. She pushed back the thoughts about how she felt her areolas were too large and that her right breast was noticeably larger and more perky then the left. At 45 her adventurous life style on the road had granted her both hard muscle and fatty curves both right where they were needed. She smiled as she swished her hips and the bright red lacy skirt swayed with them. She wore more jewelry on her body than had ever previously owned but her patron had insisted that not putting any would have her looking the part of a wastrel. She had feigned embarrassment about the heavy ruby body jewels that started at her neck and mostly draped over and encircled her tits. 

She found that she was perhaps more conservitebely dressed than most people on in the busy market place.

She was meeting with the merchant queen of Jumia today. Tameeka Jumia was not an actual queen of course, Jumia having been established on principles of anarchy and communism since it beginnings. She was however the woman who organized all trade coming in and out of Jumia since she helped found the city 30 years ago. Since thst time Jumia although small has become one of the richest cities in eastern Grandia. She was also one of the msot accomplsiehd athrimancers outside of the Logic School and the only one of note to not have ever even witnessed those orderly halls. 

Serphina walked up to the large tent and gazed at the geometric shapes and lines that crisscrossed its surface. It took her a moment to realize he lines were moving subly shift to form different angles and shapes. She suddenly got the vague impression that the shapes and lines were displaying concrete information of some kind. There eemed to be an underlying organization that although she could not read was still observable. She walked inside.

You look directly at the beautiful woman whom you presume to be Tameeka Jumia. She meets your eyes after giving your body a quick look over. Her eyes are a deep brown and full of intelligence. Her skin is a shade darker than yours and her hair is short, curly, and purple. She is wearing a cloak that seems reminiscient of those common among proffessional magical users and teachers but was bright orange and cropped short above her navel showing off her toned stomach, the robe was garish but still managed to be stylish. You get the dinsticnt impression it was both a slight jab at the solemn attitude often associated with such folks and an unironic appreciation for critical magical application and study.

THe woman seated in the center of the room smiles self assured and with a smidge of humour. &quot;Greetings Serphina Arturia Orryn-Smithe III of House Ophelia. Im delighted to finally meet you in person. I have been excitedly awaiting our date for a while now.&quot; She looks intently at your body scanning up and down several times. YOu clear your throat quietly and struggle and almsot succeed in keeping your cheechs from reddening. &quot;As I said in our letters this is not a date. I wish to interview you in a personal manner as is my custom when fact finding for my book.&quot; 

&quot;But you do wish to get to know me, no? I belive that is called a date especially with one so beautiful as yourself. Do you not find me attractive Serphina?&quot; She smiles slyly as she waits for your response.


[[Perhaps you have a point, dear Tameeka. And you are even prettier thand escribed. Shall we begin our date then?]]

A group of youths where sitting in a close circle in the back of the tent heads down, chanting. They wore robes similar to the women seated in the center of the room but they were a deep gray. As you listen closer you realize theya re chanting numerical and logical proofs and rules in quick succession. Black two dimensional lines and symbols flow out from the center of their circle. The symbols float and drift  outward in all directions until they come in contact with the tent and vanish into the fabric. This msut be the soruce of the complex lines on the exterior and you presume this tobe the sort of high level calcualtion rituals associated with arithamcancers and you take mental pictures and notes to write down later.


	&quot;The tent actually serves both a ledger of all trading coming in and out of the city as well as calulcating costs of all routes, keeping track of market value of goods in all trade territories, and determines the most profit efficient action to take.&quot;
	&quot;In case your wondering its all in a code of my own devise in case foreign traders wish to know where, when, and what we plan on importing and exporting in the following months, But theya re welcome to try adn crack it. I figure I can waste their time more by having them try and crack my code than simply learning to be good economists.&quot;

<tw-passagedata pid="17" name="The ritual completes" tags="" position="875,1702">THe chanting of the students stopped abruptly. Each of the students stood up suddenly and began to hum deeply in unison. they stood up straigt but their posture suggested they were about to spring into action. Their humming grew louder, what started as a simple bass note grew quickly in complexity. It rose up and down like waves, growing louder in strict measured patterns. Suddenly half the students broke off to hum the opposite side of the patern from the rest of the students. Soon a third group broke off to hum the mid point between the two extremes. Interlocking patterns wove into eachother in bewildering streams of sounds. Suddenly all the voices were humming a different part of the whole interlocking structure. I got an impression of an immsense structure in my mind. A hulking palace made of rules and logic and immutability. And then it crumbled. A single student, a woman hedghog-kin, had began to hum erratically. She leapt into motion her legs bending and her torsotwisting as her arms spun as she leapt gracefully into the air. Her humming grew more and more erratic and became melodic shouts and noises the mouth can make that we donbt ahve words for. She began to spin and leap in the cneter of the circle never stopping her chaotic but musical solo. Suddenly three other students joined in, not into her song but their own losing all semblence of structure but dispalying deep meotions. As the students danced I saw that each were growing increasingly emotional one sad, one jubilant, another angry and the emotions came out more and more int their actiosn and erratic melodic shouts. Suddenly all the students were leaping and spinning and crying and laughing and acreaming in all manner of emotions amd forms of song and noice. Tameeka looked on without betraying any sort of discernable reaction to these bizare events. Suddenly the woman who had started hte mad dancing halted and screamed out a stream of numbers. She screamed as if in pure adulation and pleasure. Her robes visibly wettened around her crouch and she continued to scream out the stream of numbers. One of the other students pulled themselvws away from the throng and roduced a sheet of apper and pencil from their robes. They began scribbling down the numbers and made a effort to continue listening to the screaming woman and double checking the numbers he had written down. After she had repeated her formula multiple times the student seemed pleased and wlaked the paper over to Tameeka for obviuos inspection. The rest the students were calming down and some had also lef the circle nodding apprecitaley to the student who had written down the proofs. 

Tameeka was reading the sheet intently and then spoke the whole formula outloud in a commanding voice, intoning not perfeclty but perfeclty intune with her own indiosincracies of speech. A single golden three dimensional shape popped into existentence in front of her unlike the simple black lines from before this one danced in place it bounds not scrict but almsot like Alchemists Jelly. It flitted to and frow aimlessly and playfully. 

&quot;Seraphina, do you believe the Divines give us power?&quot; She looked straight at you with those piercing eyes.

My parent was a proffesional mage. They were always so self possessed. They used their magic to do everything. It was like an extension of thier confidence. I always admired how it seemed like nothing could ruffle thier feathers. It was hard learning that was a lie, but like all fiction that gives its power as well. Truth bend with the world. like a flower in the breeze. Fictions move outside this dimension in higher vibrations. They can mimic reality without being constrained. I realized that if everyone viewed me as I viwed my guardian then reality could bend my way. atleast in a small way. 

And thats why I taught myself arithmancy without the aid of the school. The logic school has of course been a nuisance and even tried to forcibly enroll me at the age of 26. they have some rather strong opinions about not wasting arithmancy on &quot;pointless&quot; ventures. Apaprently i am tarnishing the good name. 

My students here though will show the effecacy of my methods. that is if they can actually get off their lazy asses long enough to learn the basics. 

Do you dabble in magic, Seraphina?
